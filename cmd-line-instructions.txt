SERVER/MAIN PROJECT DIRECTORY:
(this starts the project and installs dependencies)
(this is for an app that runs at heroku and has sqlite for local development)
(tip! ignore node_modules in .gitignore. when deploying to heroku it will provide its own)

npm init
-name the package something descriptive with no spaces. use project name or webpg name
-description should just be one sentence describing program a bit
-author should be me
-for the rest I can just press enter, then type y to confirm

npm install express

npm install pg 
-(for postgres)

npm install sequelize

npm install sequelize-cli

npm install --save-dev sqlite3
-(this installs sqlite3 for development only, not for deployment at heroku)
-(will be listed in package.json under devDependencies)

npx sequelize init
-for starting db model

npx sequelize model:generate --name States --attributes name:string,visited:boolean,lat:float,lon:float,zoom:integer

-makes migrations and seeders. migrations instructions for db table. makes new model states.js for JS code to interact with
-migrations can be good to document changes made to a table they are named by time created

-a seed is initial data
