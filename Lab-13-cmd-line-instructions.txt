in favored directory:
(this starts the project and installs dependencies)
(this is for an app that runs at heroku and has sqlite for local development)
(tip! ignore node_modules in .git-ignore. when deploying to heroku it will provide its own)

-name the package something descriptive with no spaces. use project name or webpg name
-description should just be one sentence describing program a bit

npm install pg

npm install sequelize

npm install sequelize-cli

npm install --save-dev sqlite3
-(this installs sqlite3 for development only, not for deployment at heroku)
